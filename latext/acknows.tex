We are thankful to Allah Almighty that he has given us opportunity to serve the people through our project and to minimize the wastage of food and to complete this project on time. We are also thankful to our supervisor Mr. Zesshan Aslam who provided us light and guidance and also his precious time to complete our project. He encourages us in every meeting to take part equally in the project. We are thankful to our families to support us financially in this project and always being there for us in time of need.
