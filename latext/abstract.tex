Food is one of the most important source of energy for the humans to survive. With the increase in the population of the world the most important thing for human that food is being wasted globally. It is observed that many people have no access to the food and face the problem of food shortage. A large amount of food that is being produced for human consumption is never consumed. On one side we see people waste food and other side we see people suffer from shortage of food. Also the food production companies face problems of their products being expired and wasted. This is the big problem and it can be solved just providing a medium to connect giver with receiver. We proposed a solution to this problem through web application. Through our web application not only we are helping NGOs and common people but also hotels and companies that can sell their near to expire food on bidding available for those who want to further donate those products or use them as their industrial need or personal. The company or the person has his own option either he wants to donate or place a bid on the product. The bidding will be performed. Those with the highest bid will get the product and then he will proceed to the payment method. Also the application provides the data transparency as user do not have to login to see the products on bid. User has to login only if he want to buy or sell his product.
